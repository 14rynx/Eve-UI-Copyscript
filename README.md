# Eve-UI-Copyscript
Simple script that alows you to automatically copy your overview, windows and hotkeys to multiple chars

# Recuirements
You need Python 3.xx to use this script, Python can be found at [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

# First use
1. Download the replace.py and open it with a text editor
2. Change the 
```user_master = "" ```
```char_master = ""```
To the character that you want to copy from 

( The easiest way to get both is that you log in the desired character and go to
```%LOCALAPPDATA%\CCP\EVE\c_program_files_eve_sharedcache_tq_tranquility\settings_Default```
and check wich user_xy and char_xy file got changed when you logged in. The XY at the end is the desired ID respectively)
3. Run ```replace.py```

# Later use
- Whenever you want your overview copied again just run ```replace.py```

# To Note
- This also replaces on the respective files for SISI
- You could automate this with Windows Task Scheduler or similar
